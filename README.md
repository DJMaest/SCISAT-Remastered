# SCISAT project remastered

Initially designed for a CSA challenge. SCISAT posed lots of interesting challenges, both scientifical and technical. At the time of
the competition, our team lacked the required technical knowledge to truly exhibit the power of data. The remastered project addresses
this exact issue.
SCISAT collects atmospheric data on varius gases. Our project concentrates on visualizing the data from the Ozone gas. 
Along with the visualization we have also provided a public api endpoint for everyone wishing to use the data we have collected.
